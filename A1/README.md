Each group will be required to develop a simple menu manager application in Java. All team members must collaboratively build this application using the agile tools they have set up in the previous section. All teams must implement the following application requirements:

Menu Ordering: For the menu ordering feature, you need to allow general users to select meals
from a predefined list of menu items available in the application. Design a user-friendly interface
where general users can browse through different categories of menu items, view details such as item names,
descriptions, and prices, and add items to their order cart. Ensure that the ordering process is straightforward,
with an option to adjust item quantities or remove items from the cart if needed. Once the user
is ready to place the order, there should be a seamless checkout process that includes selecting
delivery or pickup options and confirming the order.
Users are not required to log in; you can assume that they share the same account with limited (non-admin) access.

Order History: Implement a feature that allows users to view the order history for the application.
The order history should show details such as the order date, items ordered and total amount.
Ensure that the order history is stored securely and make sure to include options for users to search orders based on their order number.

Admin Dashboard: Create an admin dashboard that grants you access to manage various aspects of the application.
The admin dashboard should provide a comprehensive overview of the application's status,
including the number of total orders processed.
From the dashboard, admins will be able to perform special actions that cannot be performed by general users,
as listed below:
    Perform all operations that general users can complete
    Add new menu items (including a name, description and price for each item)
    Update existing items (e.g. correcting prices or descriptions); and
    Remove outdated items from the menu.
As the developers, you need to create a login system to distinguish
between admin and general users, with a distinct login and registration process
(a simple username and password-based authentication system is fine).

The application design can use any UI (terminal or GUI) for its functionality. You can decide on the application design/architecture; both text files (txt, JSON, XML, etc.) and persistent databases (SQLite, MongoDB, MySQL, etc.) are acceptable options for storing your application data. The software must always produce correct output and maintain the correct and consistent state of all included entities.

Each group must carry on the development of the Menu Application using all the tools they set up in Part 1. Teams must demonstrate the proper use of these tools and practices to ensure efficient and effective development as well as delivery of correct application behaviour. This includes:

GitHub collaboration (branching, merging and conflict resolution). Make releases and version your software properly on GitHub.
Build automation triggers successfully with appropriate reporting
Automated tests trigger successfully with appropriate test/code coverage and reporting
You must make sure your unit tests have good code coverage. You must write unit test cases that result in more than 75% code coverage.
Tests must be such that it covers all edge cases and normal cases as well. Tests must be written for the functionality of the application (listed above).
Each group must also apply relevant continuous integration practices, covered in this course, in their application development. All groups must show evidence (in their report and demo) of the proper use and application of the above-mentioned agile tools and development/CI practices.
